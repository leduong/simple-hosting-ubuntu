Hello, I'm newbie

- Share hosting with Ubuntu support with nginx via php-cgi

How to install:
Open terminal
 
1. # wget https://raw.github.com/leduong/simple-hosting-ubuntu/master/install.sh [enter]

2. # chmod +x install.sh [enter]

3. # sudo install.sh [enter]

After install: No restart; Can use it now, must start service nginx, mysql and proftpd.

Open terminal, sudo /root/addweb.sh [enter]

Good luck!
